All the source code for I Wanna Slay the Dragon of Bangan

It comes with an old version of LoveyLib, a library I made
to abstract platform-dependent interfaces. This older
version has a plethora of issues, so you probably
shouldn't use it.

I made this in 7-8 days for Duncan's I Wanna Game Jam. I
used an engine I wrote 2-3 days prior, after getting the
okay to write one for this game. Though I'd wager at least
a third of the engine's features were written during
development.

The original jam version of this game is probably lost
because I didn't use a source control, decided not to
because I can work faster without one. That doesn't mean I
don't normally use one (if that was the case I probably
wouldn't release this on github), it's just slower and I
had to pump this out.

This repo is just for the source code, so no assets are
included.

### WARNING ###
###############
This is an engine + game I rushed out in 7-8 days for a
game jam, NOT a polished engine that many will use and
rely on for years to come.

It's unstable, messy, hard to use, and very limited in
functionality. Unless you're taking it on as a challenge,
don't use this engine.
